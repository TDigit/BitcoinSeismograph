<h1> Privacy Policy </h1>

<p>
    Versility Labs GmbH and Marcel Morisse, Sachsenring 14, 23843 Bad Oldesloe operate
    http://www.bitcoinseismograph.com, http://www.bitcoinseismograph.info and all sub-domains. This page informs you of
    our policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Information we receive from users of the Site.
    We obtain the right to change our policies without notification, from time to time to our sole discretion. This
    information was prepared under usage of e-recht24.de and TermsFeed.
</p>
<p>
    We use your Personal Information only for providing and improving our service. While using our Site, we may ask you
    to provide us with certain personally identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you.
    Personally identifiable information may include, but is not limited to your name ("Personal Information"). Personal
    Information is not shared with any other party, without your explicit permission. The security of your Personal
    Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of
    electronic storage, is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means (like SSL) to protect your
    Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We observe the rules established in data protection
    laws and take the protection of the Client’s personal data seriously, including in the interest of the Client. We
    solely use personal data to understand Client’s behavior while using the website to improve the Website and aligned
    services and to prevent misuse. We store and process all Client data in accordance with the relevant provisions of
    the German Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG) and the German Telemedia Act (Telemediengesetz –
    TMG). We will not forward the personal data, including the Client’s name, address or e-mail address, to third
    parties without the Client’s expressed consent, which can be withdrawn at any time. In case, we have to forward
    personal data obligated by a German court rule, we inform our Clients about the submission of data, if contact
    details are available and informing Clients is not prohibited by court rule. This shall exclude our service partners,
    who need to receive the data to process the order and perform the service (e.g. subcontractors commissioned to
    perform the service, the company that sends out the newsletters and the financial institution commissioned to
    process payments). In these cases, however, the scope of the data provided shall be kept to the necessary minimum.
    We store Personal information only in data centers located in the Federal Republic of Germany or members of the
    European Union.
