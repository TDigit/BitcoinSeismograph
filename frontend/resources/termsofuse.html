<h2> Quantitative Data </h2>

<p>
    The Bitcoin Seismograph is a research project, which is intended to provide general information about Bitcoin and
    its community. The information on this Website is for information purposes only. The information provided on this
    website and API are collected from available sources respecting API limits or other limitations. Therefore, no
    real-time data is given. The information is analysed with statistical methods, which have been implemented to the
    best of our knowledge, but we do not guarantee that the information is accurate at every time and the website as
    well as API are free of errors or defects. We do not guarantee availability of this website at any time. We
    therefore refuse to take any liability in connection with any actions taken or not taken based on any of our
    website’s and API’s content. We do not provide any advice to users how and when to invest in Bitcoin and we do not
    recommend any particular currency or financial product.
</p>

<h2> Qualitative Data </h2>

<p>
    The Bitcoin Seismograph website and API crawls Bitcoin related forum and Reddit posts automatically and displays
    them ranked by their popularity (views count in forums and Reddit top posts). We do not filter or check posts in
    advance and thereby do not take any responsibility for the content of these posts. Views expressed in the forum or
    Reddit posts do not necessarily reflect the views of Marcel Morisse or Versility Labs. The Bitcoin Seismograph
    website and API may contain links to third-party web sites or services and may offer integration with such
    third-party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by Versility Labs and/or Marcel Morisse. The
    Providers have no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, privacy policies, or practices of
    any third party web sites or services. You further acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible or liable,
    directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or
    reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such web sites or services. In case you
    find any information on this website misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise
    objectionable in your jurisdiction, please contact us immediately via email (feedback@bitcoinseismograph.info) and
    we will exclude the information from our website and API, if required.
</p>

<h2> Personal Data Collection </h2>

<p>
    We try to avoid collecting personal data as much as possible, but for evaluating the usage of this website we
    collect usage data via GoogleAnalytics and ask for feedback via a GoogleForm. Data gathered during the evaluation is
    used for research purposes only. For more details, we refer to our Privacy Policy
</p>

<h2> Warranty Disclaimers </h2>

<p>
    THE SERVICES AND CONTENT ARE PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. WITHOUT LIMITING THE
    FOREGOING, WE EXPLICITLY DISCLAIM ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUIET
    ENJOYMENT AND NON-INFRINGEMENT AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE OF TRADE. We make no
    warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or be available on an uninterrupted, secure, or error-free
    basis. We make no warranty regarding the quality, accuracy, timeliness, truthfulness, completeness or reliability of
    any Content.
</p>

<h2> Limitation of Liability </h2>

<p>
    NEITHER THE PROVIDER NOR ANY OTHER PARTY INVOLVED IN CREATING, PRODUCING, OR DELIVERING THE SERVICES, TOOLS, OR
    CONTENT WILL BE LIABLE FOR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOSS
    OF DATA OR GOODWILL, SERVICE INTERRUPTION, COMPUTER DAMAGE OR SYSTEM FAILURE OR THE COST OF SUBSTITUTE SERVICES
    ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TERMS OR FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICES, TOOLS, OR
    CONTENT, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), PRODUCT LIABILITY OR ANY OTHER LEGAL
    THEORY, AND WHETHER OR NOT THE PROVIDER HAS BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE, EVEN IF A LIMITED
    REMEDY SET FORTH HEREIN IS FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY
    TO YOU.
</p>

<h2> General Terms </h2>

<p>
    These Terms constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and agreement between THE PROVIDER and you regarding
    the Services and Content, and these Terms supersede and replace any and all prior oral or written understandings or
    agreements between THE PROVIDER and you regarding the Services and Content. If for any reason an arbitrator or court
    of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
    enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and
    effect.
</p>

<p>
    You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without THE PROVIDER’s prior written
    consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms, without such consent, will be null and of no effect.
    THE PROVIDER may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms
    will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.
</p>

<p>
    THE PROVIDER’s failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of those
    rights. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under
    these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.
